These cases were meant to be run on 512 nodes of Cetus, in c32
mode (32 MPI ranks per node).


Polynomial degrees ranging from 2 (lx1=3) to 11 (lx1=12) were
considered.

The largest element counts were not used with the highest polynomial
order -- that would yield too many points.

The cases considered are given in the table below.

All cases were run with zsin.usr.

The data files are printed as follows:
ranks N Nel/rank Nelgt points pts/rank iters elapsed_time_scalar dofs/sec_scalar time/iter_scalar time/iter-pt_scalar elapsed_time_vector dofs/sec_vector time/iter_vector time/iter-pt_vector
